This is the first of three (or four) labs. Its purpose is to _1)_ allow you to
get hands-on experience with game trees, and _2)_ to ensure that your computer
setup is up and running. Having installed `uv`#footnote[#link(
  "https://docs.astral.sh/uv/",
  "docs.astral.sh/uv",
)] (python installer and dependency manager), and cloned our repo
#footnote[#link(
  "https://github.com/syrkis/aigs",
  "github.com/syrkis/aigs",
)], run `uv sync` to install all dependencies. I recommend using Zed
#footnote[#link(
  "https://zed.dev",
  "zed.dev",
)] if you are on a Unix system and Notepad++, VSCode or Sublime if you are not
(but anything will do). We will explore this lab in the coming sessions.

= Connect four

`aigs/games.py` contains an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. You have to:
- Look at the code and understand it
- Discuss with neighbor how connect four is different from tic tac toe
- Create a child class of `Env` called `ConnectFour`
- Implement an `init() -> State` method
- Implement a `step(state, action) -> State` method.

= Minimax

The minimax function has the signature
`minimax(state: State, maxim: bool) -> int`. In plain English: it takes a state
and a boolean (indicating if we are maximizing or minimizing) and returns an
integer (representing value). When we want to take an action, then, we call
minimax for each of our potential actions, and take the action with the highest
value. You have to:
- Implement the minimax function
- Call it for every potential action
- Then take the action with the highest value

= $alpha-beta$ pruning

One common sense modification to minimax is to break early when a particular
branch allows the oponent something better than what we are already guaranteed
to have. The function signature then becomes
`alpha_beta(state: State, maxim: bool, alpha: int, beta: int) -> int`. You have
to:
- Copy your minimax function
- Add input parameters $alpha$ and $beta$
- Modify the function to break early when appropriate


= Heuristic variations

Notice how we never actually _looked_ at the game board to gaguge its value, but
instead we fully complete games, exhaustively exploring the game tree. Already
for connect-four, the combinatoric explosion leaves exhaustive search
intractable. One solution is heuristics (rules of thumb). Shannon's 1950s chess
program used heuristics @shannon1950. Rather than always fully finishing every
simulated game, he'd maximally look $n$ steps into the future, and then evaluate
the board using a _heuristic_—a linear combination of manually crafted features
(e.g.,
$0.3 times "number of pawns in the center" + 0.1 times "mean distance from ally pawn to enemy king"$,
or whatever.) You have to:
- Create a heuristic function that given a board returns a value
- Copy your minimax function, and add a depth parameter
- Modify the function to return winner if terminated or heuristic value of depth
  is 0
- Think about how a neural network could be used here



= Monte Carlo tree search (famously hard for games students)

Even with $alpha-beta$ pruning, we are still exhaustively searching through the
game tree (in what we know for sure not to be dead ends). Why not just sample?
When faced with a choice of making move $a$ or $b$ we could simulate $n$
potential futures for each possibility and count outcomes. There are many
variations and smart tricks to MCTS @browne2012. You have to
- Implement a rollout function
- Implement a backpropagation function
- Implement a selection function
- Implement an expansion function
- Combine the above into MCTS
